# my-personal-blog
This repository is basically the repository of [my own personal blog](http://ricardovsilva.herokkuapp.com).
I spend one night to learn how to use [Jekyll](http://jekylrb.com) (recomended by [Jhonny Moreira](https://github.com/jhonnymoreira)). And, more and more I'm loving Ruby.

## What am I using?
- Programming Language: Basically Ruby to backend and some html, css and js to frontend
- Programming IDE: Cloud9, just fantastic, I can program and deploy from anywhere
- Source Control: As anyone can see, Github
- Host: Heroku, I really know little about heroku, but it already won my love

## What's the point?
The point is, learn to can teach. Teaching I will learn more, learning more, I can teach more.

I win, who reads win, evebody wins, evebody be happy :).
 
## This repo is at what stage?
The blog is completely functional, very ugly yet, but functional. 
If you never worked or heard about [Jekyll](http://jekylrb.com), I really recomend take a look at [docs](jekyllrb.com/docs)
Feel free to fork and use that as your start point.
If you have any doubt, suggestion or affliction, let me know (maybe open a issue is a good idea)
